## Course Description

CDS DS 453 investigates techniques for performing trustworthy data analyses without a trusted party, and for conducting data science without data. The first half of the course investigates cryptocurrencies, the blockchain technology underpinning them, and the incentives for each participant, while the second half of the course focuses on privacy and anonymity using advanced tools from cryptography. The course concludes with a broader exploration into the power of conducting data science without being able to see the underlying data.
